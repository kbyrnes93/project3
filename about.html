					<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
						<p>My name is Katie, I am a 25-year-old, London based, established Freelance Web Developer. I am an enthusiastic and hardworking individual whose main focus is keeping my clients happy and delivering excellent web designs and amazing customer service. I have a varied portfolio and I am looking to take on more challenges that arise. I like to build a good relationship with my client and help them to build the picture they have in their head of their website.</p>

					<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
						<p>My hobbies include going to the gym and keeping fit, this is so I can enjoy my next hobby which is food! I love going out to eat at nice restaurants and trying lots of different types of food, Indian food being a favourite of mine. I have a keen interest in technology, I like to keep up to date with the latest gadgets and tech news. I also love travelling and want to explore as many new places as possible! My last adventure was travelling across the Caribbean last year, I visited over 10 islands. Below is a picture of the Pitons in Saint Lucia, a stunning place.</p>
